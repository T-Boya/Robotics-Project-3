# Robotics-Project-3

## Running Instructions
Open main.m and run it. This is the main controller file and all other dependencies are called by it.

## To see results
## Question 1
Results are plotted but also stored in arrays 'quat', 'eulers' and 'betas'.

## Question 2
POE, SDH and MDH parameters can be found in the pdf.
The forward kinematics can be found in the T array.
Inverse kinematics are not stored but can be seen by setting a breakpoint on line 124

## Question 3
Angular velocity is stored in an array called 'velocities', the maximum is stored in a variable called 'highestspeed'.
Variance is stored in an array called 'variation', the minimum is stored in a variable called 'minvariance'.
